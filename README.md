# Editor Spotlight

Simple MacOS-like Spotlight file search in Unity. It shows your most opened files first. The more you use it, the better it gets.

## How to use
- Open with Alt + F.
- Select a result with arrow keys.
- Press Enter to open the file or Tab to select it in the project panel.

## Known issues

- If you try to open a script while VS is closed, Unity will hang.
